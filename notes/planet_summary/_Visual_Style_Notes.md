# ðŸŽ¨ Visual Style Notes

- **Lighting Philosophy:** Each planet should have a _primary color signature_ â€” Pandora = cyan/green glow, Arrakis = gold/orange, Crystalis = pale blue, Exotica = rainbow fractal, Stormworld = lightning yellow/white, Hollow World = cyan/purple/black, Dyson Swarm = reflective silver, Neutron Forge = red/blue-white plasma.
- **UI Consistency:** Biomes could use **color-coded fog tints** (via Terrablender biome settings) to sell immersion â€” purple haze in void zones, gold haze in desert planets, blue frost mist in Crystalis.
- **Mob Design:** Each mob should feel _alien but functional_ â€” textures should avoid looking like reskinned vanilla mobs. Use exaggerated geometries (floating sacs, fractal horns, plasma veins, crystal hides).
