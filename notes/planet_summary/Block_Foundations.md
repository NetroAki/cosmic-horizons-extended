# Block Foundations

- **Planetary Stone Base:** Each planet uses a unique â€œstoneâ€ type (Cryostone, Stormstone, Hollowstone, etc.) with texture variants (cracked, mossy, crystal-encrusted, etc.).
- **Soils:** Most planets use custom â€œmetallicâ€ or â€œhybridâ€ soils that tie to their biome logic.
- **Glowing Flora Blocks:** A consistent system of faint light-emitting plants/moss/fungi across all biomes keeps readability in dark alien spaces.
