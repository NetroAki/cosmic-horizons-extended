# ðŸ›  Scaffold Rings

- **Terrain/Palette:**
  Vast lattice scaffolding arcs, half-collapsed, circling the swarm. Platforms float and rotate slowly.

- **Ground Blocks:**

  - _Scaffold Struts_ â†’ dark-grey alloy lattice.
  - _Rotary Nodes_ â†’ moving structural parts.

- **Fauna:**

  - _Scaffold Serpents_ â†’ mechanical serpents slithering through struts. Drop **Scaffold Scales** â†’ GT composites.
  - _Orb Drones_ â†’ spherical bots orbiting nodes. Drop **Drone Alloys** â†’ GT robotics.

- **Mini-Boss:** **Scaffold Titan**

  - Gigantic construct built from lattice segments, humanoid in shape.
  - Abilities: swings scaffold limbs, collapses sections of arena.
  - Drops: **Scaffold Core** â†’ GT titanium-niobium alloys.
