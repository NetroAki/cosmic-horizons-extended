# ðŸŒŸ Main Boss: **Sand Emperor**

- **Arena:**
  Found beneath the Great Dunes in a massive sunken pit. The ground constantly shifts like quicksand. Stone pillars collapse during the fight as the worm tunnels beneath.

- **Phases:**

  1. **Burrow Phase:** Worm disappears under sand, erupts beneath players. Creates collapsing sinkholes.
  2. **Surface Phase:** Emerges fully, smashing pillars and hurling sand geysers.
  3. **Storm Phase:** Summons massive sandstorm â†’ arena darkens, lightning strikes randomly. Worm charges through sand clouds in hit-and-run attacks.

  - **Sandpiercer** â†’ spear weapon. Strong melee thrust, special ability: sandburst AoE (knockback).
  - **Spice Crown** â†’ rare headpiece, grants night vision + sandstorm resistance.
