# ðŸœ Great Dunes

- **Terrain/Palette:**
  Rolling dunes of fine **Arrakite Sand**, colored warm gold by day, deep orange at twilight. Wind-blown ridges shift shape procedurally. Occasional exposed sandstone ridges break the monotony.

- **Ground Blocks:**

  - _Arrakite Sand_ (custom golden sand, slightly finer particle effect).
  - _Dune Fossil Sandstone_ (rare, embedded fossil textures).

- **Flora:**
  Sparse vegetation â€” hardy _Spice Cactus_ with glowing red pods (used in GT chemistry as a source of spice extract). _Dune Grass_ grows in ridges, waving in the hot winds.

- **Fauna:**

  - _Sand Striders_ â†’ camel-sized quadrupeds with elongated legs and armored hides. Hump-like growths store water. Drop **Hydrated Tissue**, processed into GT electrolytes/chemical coolants.
  - _Sand Burrowers_ â†’ worm-like mobs that erupt from sand in ambush. Their bodies are segmented and armored, with ringed teeth in circular mouths. Drop **Silicate Chitin**, used in GT composites.

- **Mini-Boss:** **Dune Wyrm Alpha**

  - Gigantic worm (\~15 blocks long, half exposed at a time). Body is armored in red-gold chitin.
  - Mechanics: burrows, emerges in ambush, causes sand geysers on surface. Knockback tremors.
  - Drops: **Wyrm Core** â†’ needed for advanced GT drill heads and cutting tools.
