# ðŸŽ¯ Design Goals

- **Integration-first:** Every planet, mob, and boss ties directly into GregTech CEuâ€™s tech tree â€” no â€œdecorativeâ€ content without progression relevance.
- **Planetary Identity:** Each planet feels distinct in color palette, flora, fauna, hazards, and progression step. Players should be able to tell _at a glance_ where they are.
- **Challenge Scaling:** Planets progress from lush/hostile natural worlds â†’ engineered megastructures â†’ stellar phenomena â†’ neutron/exotic-matter realms. Each stage increases both survival difficulty and complexity of GT systems unlocked.
- **Alien Authenticity:** Default Minecraft mobs never appear. Every fauna is designed to fulfill an ecological and mechanical role (e.g., grazers = food/organic resources, predators = catalysts, drones = alloys).
- **Boss-Gated Progression:** Each planet has **3 mini-bosses + 1 main boss**. Mini-bosses drop _Cores_ that are required for GregTech crafting chains; main bosses drop the _planetary unlock_ for the next tier.
