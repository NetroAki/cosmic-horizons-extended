  This is a placeholder structure file. In a real implementation, this would be a binary NBT file.
  To create the actual structure:
  1. Build the arena in a creative world
  2. Use structure blocks to save it
  3. Export the structure to the correct location

  Arena Design Guidelines:
  - 64x64 block area
  - Raised platform with sun-themed decorations
  - Central summoning platform for the boss
  - Phase transition triggers
  - Environmental hazards
  - Player respawn points
  - Visual indicators for phase changes

  Save the structure as 'chex:structures/stellar_avatar_arena/arena.nbt'
