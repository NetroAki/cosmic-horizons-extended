# Future Work Stub

This page tracks the systems we are intentionally deferring while we get the core add-on functional. Use it as the single source when we circle back for bespoke gameplay content.

## Entities

- Replace every placeholder cube renderer with bespoke geometry, animations, and loot tables.
- Implement full AI packages (pathing, attacks, abilities, environmental interactions).
- Wire custom drops and progression hooks (Spore Tyrant cores, Ash Crawler embers, Ocean Sovereign loot, etc.).

## Structures

- Procedural boss arenas (Pandora fungal sanctum, Arrakis spice cavern, Inferno magma citadel, Aqua sanctum).
- Surface/world-feature structures (spy towers, research outposts, abandoned habitats).
- GT ore distribution structures and in-world hints (mining camps, probe wrecks).

## AI & Events

- Planet hazard controllers (levitation updrafts, heat auras, spore haze, sandstorms).
- Planet-specific ambient behaviours (Glowbeast herds, Sporefly swarm logic, Stormworld weather AI).
- Boss phase scripting and cinematic hooks (intro sequences, ability telegraphs, retreat/respawn logic).

Weâ€™ll return to these once planet terrain + progression loops are in place. Update the table above whenever you add stubs, block out features, or promote work into active development.
