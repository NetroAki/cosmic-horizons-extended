# T-190 Saturn GTCEu Integration

**Goal**

- Add ring material processing and gravitational technology to enhance Saturn [EXISTING] with GTCEu integration.

**Scope**

- Ring material processing chains
- Gravitational technology recipes
- GTCEu integration for ring and gravitational technology

**Acceptance**

- Ring material processing: GTCEu recipes for converting ring particles
- Gravitational technology: Advanced technology that manipulates gravity
- Integration: Seamless connection between ring resources and GTCEu technology
- Progression: Ring materials unlock advanced particle and gravitational systems
- Balance: Appropriate resource distribution and processing requirements
- `./gradlew check` passes
