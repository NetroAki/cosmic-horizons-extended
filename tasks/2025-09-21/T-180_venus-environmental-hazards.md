# T-180 Venus Environmental Hazards

**Goal**

- Add acid rain, extreme pressure, and toxic atmosphere hazards to enhance Venus [EXISTING] with challenging environmental conditions.

**Scope**

- Environmental hazard systems for Venus
- Atmospheric pressure and toxicity mechanics
- Acid rain weather effects and damage

**Acceptance**

- Acid rain: Periodic weather events that cause corrosive damage
- Extreme pressure: Pressure-based hazards requiring specialized equipment
- Toxic atmosphere: Atmospheric toxicity that requires life support systems
- Each hazard requires appropriate countermeasures and equipment
- Integration with suit systems and GTCEu technology
- `./gradlew check` passes
