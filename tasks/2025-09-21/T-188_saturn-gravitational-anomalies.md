# T-188 Saturn Gravitational Anomalies

**Goal**

- Add gravity-based mechanics and effects to enhance Saturn [EXISTING] with unique gravitational gameplay.

**Scope**

- Gravitational anomaly systems
- Gravity-based mechanics and physics
- Gravitational effect technology

**Acceptance**

- Gravitational anomalies: Areas with unique gravitational properties
- Gravity-based mechanics: Physics systems that respond to gravitational changes
- Gravitational effects: Technology that manipulates or responds to gravity
- Integration with GTCEu for gravitational technology
- Progression: Gravitational anomalies unlock advanced gravity manipulation
- `./gradlew check` passes
