# T-179 Venus GTCEu Integration

**Goal**

- Add atmospheric processing chains and acid-resistant materials to enhance Venus [EXISTING] with GTCEu integration.

**Scope**

- Atmospheric processing chains
- Acid-resistant material recipes
- GTCEu integration for atmospheric technology

**Acceptance**

- Atmospheric processing: GTCEu recipes for converting atmospheric gases
- Acid-resistant materials: Advanced materials that resist corrosion
- Integration: Seamless connection between atmospheric resources and GTCEu technology
- Progression: Atmospheric materials unlock advanced gas processing and acid resistance
- Balance: Appropriate resource distribution and processing requirements
- `./gradlew check` passes
