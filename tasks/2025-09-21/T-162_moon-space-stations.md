# T-162 Moon Space Stations

**Goal**

- Add orbital space stations and lunar bases to enhance Moon [EXISTING] with infrastructure and habitation.

**Scope**

- Structure generation for orbital space stations
- Lunar base structures with habitation modules
- Space station and base functionality systems

**Acceptance**

- Orbital space stations: Floating structures with docking bays and research facilities
- Lunar bases: Ground-based habitation modules with life support systems
- Space stations provide access to advanced technology and resources
- Lunar bases serve as safe havens and research outposts
- Both structures integrate with progression systems
- `./gradlew check` passes
