# T-205 Pluto GTCEu Integration

**Goal**

- Add dwarf planet materials and cryogenic processing to enhance Pluto [EXISTING] with GTCEu integration.

**Scope**

- Dwarf planet material processing chains
- Cryogenic processing recipes
- GTCEu integration for dwarf planet technology

**Acceptance**

- Dwarf planet materials: GTCEu recipes for processing Pluto-specific resources
- Cryogenic processing: Advanced technology for processing frozen materials
- Integration: Seamless connection between dwarf planet resources and GTCEu technology
- Progression: Dwarf planet materials unlock advanced cryogenic systems
- Balance: Appropriate resource distribution and processing requirements
- `./gradlew check` passes
