# T-185 Jupiter Environmental Hazards

**Goal**

- Add extreme pressure, wind storms, and lightning hazards to enhance Jupiter [EXISTING] with challenging environmental conditions.

**Scope**

- Environmental hazard systems for Jupiter
- Atmospheric pressure and wind mechanics
- Lightning storm effects and damage

**Acceptance**

- Extreme pressure: Pressure-based hazards requiring specialized equipment
- Wind storms: High-speed winds that affect movement and structures
- Lightning: Electrical hazards that can damage equipment and players
- Each hazard requires appropriate countermeasures and equipment
- Integration with suit systems and GTCEu technology
- `./gradlew check` passes
