# T-193 Uranus Extreme Cold Biomes

**Goal**

- Add 5+ new biomes adapted to extreme cold to enhance Uranus [EXISTING] with diverse cryogenic environments.

**Scope**

- `forge/src/main/resources/data/cosmic_horizons_extended/worldgen/biome/uranus_*.json`
- Biome-specific terrain generation and cryogenic effects
- Extreme cold adaptation systems

**Acceptance**

- 5+ new biomes: Each adapted to extreme cold conditions
- Cryogenic effects: Unique environmental effects for each biome
- Cold adaptation: Systems for surviving extreme cold
- Each biome provides unique resources and challenges
- Integration with GTCEu for cryogenic technology
- `./gradlew check` passes
