# T-192 Uranus Cryogenic Processing

**Goal**

- Add supercooled material processing chains to enhance Uranus [EXISTING] with advanced cryogenic technology.

**Scope**

- Cryogenic processing chains
- Supercooled material recipes
- GTCEu integration for cryogenic technology

**Acceptance**

- Cryogenic processing: GTCEu recipes for processing supercooled materials
- Supercooled materials: Advanced materials that require cryogenic processing
- Integration: Seamless connection between ice resources and GTCEu technology
- Progression: Cryogenic materials unlock advanced cooling and storage systems
- Balance: Appropriate resource distribution and processing requirements
- `./gradlew check` passes
