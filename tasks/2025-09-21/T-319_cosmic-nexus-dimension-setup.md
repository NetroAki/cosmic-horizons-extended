# T-319 Cosmic Nexus Dimension Setup

**Goal**

- Create reality-bending dimension with pure vacuum, reality distortions, and variable gravity for Cosmic Nexus (Tier 15+ Ultimate Endgame).

**Scope**

- `forge/src/main/resources/data/cosmic_horizons_extended/dimension/cosmic_nexus.json`
- Reality-bending environment and extreme physics systems
- Variable gravity and reality manipulation mechanics

**Acceptance**

- Reality-bending dimension with pure vacuum and reality distortions
- Variable gravity (0.1g to 3.0g) with shifting gravity wells
- Reality rifts that teleport players randomly or cause instant death
- Temporal storms that cause equipment aging/reversal
- Cosmic radiation damage even with max shielding
- Ultimate GT space suits with reality stabilization fields required
- `./gradlew check` passes
