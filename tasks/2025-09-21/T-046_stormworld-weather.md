# T46: Stormworld Weather Implementation

## Overview

Implement dynamic weather systems for the Stormworld dimension, including electrical storms, wind mechanics, and special effects.

## Tasks

### 1. Electrical Storms

- [ ] Create `StormworldWeatherManager` class
  - Handle storm intensity and duration
  - Manage storm transitions and cooldowns
  - Sync weather state to clients
- [ ] Implement storm effects
  - Darken sky during storms
  - Add storm sound effects
  - Create particle effects for rain and wind

### 2. Wind Mechanics

- [ ] Create `WindSystem` class
  - Generate wind direction and strength
  - Apply wind forces to entities and particles
  - Create wind sound effects
- [ ] Implement wind interaction
  - Affect player movement and projectiles
  - Create wind-affected particles
  - Add visual wind lines and debris

### 3. Lightning System

- [ ] Create `StormworldLightningBolt` entity
  - Custom lightning rendering
  - Damage and effect system
  - Chain lightning mechanics
- [ ] Implement lightning effects
  - Screen flash and thunder sounds
  - Electrical particle effects
  - Temporary light sources

### 4. Weather Cycles

- [ ] Configure weather patterns
  - Storm frequency and duration
  - Calm periods between storms
  - Rare supercell storms
- [ ] Add weather transitions
  - Smooth transitions between weather states
  - Warning systems for incoming storms
  - Post-storm effects

## Implementation Notes

- Use Forge's weather event system
- Optimize for performance with many particles
- Add configuration options for all weather parameters
- Ensure compatibility with other dimensions' weather systems

## Dependencies

- Stormworld dimension (T45)
- Stormworld biomes (T47)
