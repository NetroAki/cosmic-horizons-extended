# T-320 Cosmic Nexus Biome Implementation

**Goal**

- Implement 5 unique biomes for Cosmic Nexus with reality-bending, temporal, and cosmic environments.

**Scope**

- `forge/src/main/resources/data/cosmic_horizons_extended/worldgen/biome/cosmic_nexus_*.json`
- Biome-specific terrain generation and reality-bending effects
- Temporal and cosmic exploration systems

**Acceptance**

- Reality Cores: Floating platforms of pure cosmic energy, constantly shifting between matter states
- Temporal Fields: Areas where time flows differently, creating temporal paradoxes
- Nexus Platforms: Massive floating platforms made of ultimate alloys from cosmic civilization
- Void Rifts: Areas where reality has torn, revealing void beyond with broken physics
- Cosmic Gardens: Areas where life evolved to cosmic scales with living crystals and sentient metals
- Each biome has distinct visual characteristics and reality-bending effects
- `./gradlew check` passes
