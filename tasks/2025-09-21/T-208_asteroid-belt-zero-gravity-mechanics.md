# T-208 Asteroid Belt Zero-Gravity Mechanics

**Goal**

- Add unique zero-gravity gameplay mechanics to enhance Asteroid Belt [EXISTING] with space-based physics.

**Scope**

- Zero-gravity physics systems
- Space-based movement and interaction
- Zero-gravity specific gameplay mechanics

**Acceptance**

- Zero-gravity physics: Unique physics systems that work in space
- Space movement: Specialized movement mechanics for zero-gravity
- Zero-gravity interactions: Unique ways to interact with objects in space
- Integration with GTCEu for space-based technology
- Progression: Zero-gravity mechanics unlock advanced space systems
- `./gradlew check` passes
