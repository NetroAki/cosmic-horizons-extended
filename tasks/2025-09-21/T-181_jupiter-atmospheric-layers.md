# T-181 Jupiter Atmospheric Layers

**Goal**

- Add multiple atmospheric depth zones with different properties to enhance Jupiter [EXISTING] with layered atmospheric exploration.

**Scope**

- Atmospheric layer generation and mechanics
- Depth-based atmospheric properties
- Atmospheric layer transition systems

**Acceptance**

- Multiple atmospheric layers: Different zones with unique properties and hazards
- Depth-based properties: Atmospheric characteristics that change with depth
- Layer transitions: Smooth transitions between different atmospheric zones
- Each layer provides unique resources and challenges
- Integration with GTCEu for atmospheric processing technology
- `./gradlew check` passes
