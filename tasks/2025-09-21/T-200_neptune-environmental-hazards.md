# T-200 Neptune Environmental Hazards

**Goal**

- Add extreme pressure, wind storms, and deep ocean effects to enhance Neptune [EXISTING] with challenging environmental conditions.

**Scope**

- Environmental hazard systems for Neptune
- Atmospheric pressure and wind mechanics
- Deep ocean effects and damage

**Acceptance**

- Extreme pressure: Pressure-based hazards requiring specialized equipment
- Wind storms: High-speed winds that affect movement and structures
- Deep ocean effects: Underwater hazards that require pressure protection
- Each hazard requires appropriate countermeasures and equipment
- Integration with suit systems and GTCEu technology
- `./gradlew check` passes
