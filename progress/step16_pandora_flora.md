# Pandora Flora Generation Implementation

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of Pandora's flora generation, including fungal towers, skybark trees, kelp forests, and other biome-specific vegetation.

## Implementation Status

### Fungal Towers

- [x] Base implementation in `pandora_fungal_tower.json`
- [x] Custom feature class: `PandoraFungalTowerFeature`
- [x] Register feature in `CHEXFeatures`
- [x] Add to biomes (Bioluminescent Forest)
- [ ] Test generation

### Skybark Trees

- [x] Base implementation in `pandora_skybark_trees.json`
- [x] Custom feature class: `SkybarkTreeFeature`
- [x] Register feature in `CHEXFeatures`
- [x] Add to biomes (Floating Mountains)
- [ ] Test generation

### Kelp Forests

- [x] Base implementation in `pandora_kelp_forests.json`
- [x] Custom feature class: `PandoraKelpForestFeature`
- [x] Register feature in `CHEXFeatures`
- [x] Add to ocean biomes (Ocean Depths)
- [ ] Test generation

### Magma Spires

- [x] Base implementation in `pandora_magma_spire.json`
- [x] Custom feature class: `MagmaSpireFeature`
- [x] Register feature in `CHEXFeatures`
- [x] Add to volcanic biomes (Volcanic Wastes)
- [ ] Test generation

### Cloudstone Islands

- [x] Base implementation in `pandora_cloudstone_islands.json`
- [x] Custom feature class: `CloudstoneIslandFeature`
- [x] Register feature in `CHEXFeatures`
- [x] Add to floating mountains biome
- [ ] Test generation

## Testing Instructions

### In-Game Testing

1. **Fungal Towers**

   - Travel to the Bioluminescent Forest biome
   - Look for tall fungal structures with glowing caps
   - Verify they generate at an appropriate density
   - Check for proper integration with terrain

2. **Skybark Trees**

   - Locate the Floating Mountains biome
   - Check for tall, twisted trees with biolume moss
   - Verify they generate on mountain peaks and floating islands
   - Ensure they don't generate in inappropriate locations

3. **Kelp Forests**

   - Find the Ocean Depths biome
   - Look for dense kelp growth with biolume kelp variants
   - Verify they generate at appropriate depths
   - Check for proper water interaction

4. **Magma Spires**

   - Travel to the Volcanic Wastes biome
   - Look for tall magma structures with lava flows
   - Verify they generate with appropriate spacing
   - Check for proper terrain integration

5. **Cloudstone Islands**
   - Return to the Floating Mountains biome
   - Look for small floating islands in the air
   - Verify they generate at appropriate heights
   - Check for proper decoration (moss, crystals, etc.)

### Expected Results

- All features should generate in their respective biomes
- No floating or buried features (unless intentional)
- No generation errors in the console
- Reasonable performance during world generation

### Common Issues to Check

- Features not generating (check biome tags and placement rules)
- Features generating in wrong biomes (verify biome filters)
- Performance issues with dense feature generation
- Visual glitches or incorrect block placement

## Next Steps

1. Document any issues found during testing
2. Adjust spawn rates and configurations as needed
3. Update documentation with final implementation details
4. Mark the task as complete in the task tracking system
