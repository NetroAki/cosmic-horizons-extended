# T-056 Aqua Mundus Blocks Implementation

## Overview
Implemented the core blocks for the Aqua Mundus water-world dimension, including vent basalt, manganese nodules, luminous kelp, and ice shelf variants.

## Blocks Added

### 1. Vent Basalt
- **Type**: Decorative block
- **Properties**:
  - Dark, porous rock with slight glow
  - Found near hydrothermal vents
  - Can be crafted into polished variant

### 2. Polished Vent Basalt
- **Type**: Decorative block (crafted)
- **Properties**:
  - Smoother variant of vent basalt
  - Used for building underwater structures
  - Maintains slight glow

### 3. Manganese Nodule
- **Type**: Ore block
- **Properties**:
  - Rare mineral deposit
  - Drops manganese nodules when mined
  - Affected by Fortune enchantment

### 4. Luminous Kelp
- **Type**: Underwater plant
- **Properties**:
  - Glowing underwater plant
  - Provides light source
  - Can be used for decoration and lighting

### 5. Ice Shelf
- **Type**: Solid block
- **Properties**:
  - Thick, durable ice variant
  - Doesn't melt
  - Slippery surface

### 6. Ice Shelf Slab
- **Type**: Slab variant
- **Properties**:
  - Half-block version of ice shelf
  - Crafted from ice shelf blocks
  - Maintains parent block properties

## Technical Implementation
- Added block registration and item models
- Configured block properties and behaviors
- Set up loot tables for all blocks
- Added support for tool requirements
- Implemented special behaviors (glow, slipperiness, etc.)

## Next Steps
1. Add world generation for these blocks in Aqua Mundus
2. Create crafting recipes for craftable blocks
3. Implement block entity for special interactions
4. Add more decorative variants and blocks
5. Test block interactions and balance

## Testing Notes
- Verify all blocks appear in creative inventory
- Test block breaking and collection
- Check light levels for luminous blocks
- Verify ice shelf properties (melting, slipperiness)
- Test world generation in Aqua Mundus
