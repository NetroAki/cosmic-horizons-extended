# Step 19 - Spawn-All Branch Script (2025-09-21)

- Added scripts/spawn_all_task_branches.sh to iterate tasks/ directories, create feature/<slug> branches, generate claim files, and push them automatically unless branches already exist locally or remotely.
- Script accepts an optional task directory argument (defaults to latest tasks/*/) and logs progress for each branch.
