# T-222 JEI Integration — Completed

Summary

- Registered JEI plugin and categories:
  - `CHEXJeiPlugin` with recipe types `rocket_assembly` and `planet_resources`.
  - Categories: `RocketAssemblyCategory`, `PlanetResourcesCategory`.
  - Recipes: `RocketAssemblyRecipe` (tiers 1–5), `PlanetResourcesRecipe` (parsed from bundled `chex-minerals.json5`).
- Added localization keys for category titles and lines in `en_us.json`.

Verification

- JEI categories appear with translatable titles and rendered text lines.
- Recipes populated for baseline tiers and a subset of planets from the minerals config.
- Acceptance satisfied: JEI displays custom categories with correct data.
