# Alpha Centauri Entities Implementation (T-043)

## Overview
Implemented the Solar Engineer Drone entity for the Alpha Centauri dimension, completing the set of entities for this task. The Solar Engineer Drone is a flying mechanical enemy that repairs structures and attacks players.

## Changes Made

### 1. Solar Engineer Drone Entity
- Created `SolarEngineerDrone.java` with custom AI behaviors:
  - Flying movement with smooth pathfinding
  - Repair behavior for nearby structures
  - Energy-based attacks with electric shock effects
  - Solar-powered energy regeneration
  - Custom animations and particle effects

### 2. Entity Registration
- Added Solar Engineer Drone to `ModEntities.java`
- Configured spawn rules for the photosphere_platforms biome
- Set up proper entity attributes and properties

### 3. Features
- **Energy System**: Drones use energy for attacks and repairs, recharging in sunlight
- **Repair Behavior**: Will attempt to repair nearby damaged structures when not in combat
- **Combat**: Shocks players on contact, dealing damage and setting them on fire
- **Visuals**: Electric particle effects and custom animations
- **Drops**: Glowstone dust and occasional gold ingots

## Testing
- [ ] Verify drone spawning in Alpha Centauri dimension
- [ ] Test repair behavior with damaged structures
- [ ] Check combat mechanics and damage values
- [ ] Verify energy regeneration in sunlight
- [ ] Test loot drops

## Next Steps
1. Create textures and models for the Solar Engineer Drone
2. Add sound effects for movement, attacks, and repairs
3. Balance spawn rates and difficulty
4. Add more advanced repair behaviors for modded blocks

## Notes
- The drone's repair behavior is currently basic and could be expanded to work with modded blocks
- Consider adding different drone variants with specialized behaviors
- May need to adjust energy consumption/regeneration rates based on playtesting
