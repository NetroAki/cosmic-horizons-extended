# Compilation Fixes Progress Log

This log captures the incremental status while executing the nine compilation-fix tasks defined in `progress/compilation_fixes`.

| Task | Description                  | Status      | Error Count Notes                                                                                                                                |

Additional notes will be appended under each task as work progresses.

## Task 01 Notes

- Added registry entries for `Sporefly`, `Sporeling`, `Elite Sporeling`, and Stormworld fauna inside `forge/src/main/java/com/netroaki/chex/registry/entities/CHEXEntities.java`.
- Replaced references to unimplemented entities in Pandora biome definitions with existing registry entries (`FloatingIslands`, `CrystalwoodGrove`, `LuminousCanopyForest`, `SporehazeThicket`).
- Introduced placeholder item registrations for `luminous_dust` and `spore_tyrant_heart` in `forge/src/main/java/com/netroaki/chex/registry/items/CHEXItems.java`.
- Resolved ambiguous `AbilityManager` constructor usage in `forge/src/main/java/com/netroaki/chex/entity/Sporefly.java`.
- Follow-up `./gradlew compileJava --no-daemon --console=plain` still reports **100 errors**; outstanding failures are now centered on missing Spore Cloud classes and unimplemented `PowerableMob` contract, which align with upcoming tasks.

## Task 02 Notes

- Added placeholder stormworld and spore projectile entities (`SporeCloudEntity`, `SporeCloudProjectile`, `StormworldLightningBolt`) plus registry wiring in `forge/src/main/java/com/netroaki/chex/registry/entities/CHEXEntities.java`.
- Hardened Pandora boss implementations: `SporeTyrant` classes now satisfy `PowerableMob`, use proper imports, and spawn the new projectile; `SporeCloudAbility` now gates server-side particle logic on `ServerLevel`.
- Filled out supporting item hooks (`CRYSTAL_SHARD`, `RARE_CRYSTAL_SHARD`, `ENERGIZED_CRYSTAL_SHARD`) so armor materials reference concrete registry objects.
- Introduced storm fauna scaffolding (Stormcaller/Windrider/StaticJelly attribute factories, sound usage fixes) and aligned client imports (`ParticleProvider`, `LightTexture`, `GeoLayerRenderer`, `StructureType`).
- Validation run `./gradlew compileJava --no-daemon --console=plain` continues to report **100 errors**; with worldgen packages stubbed/excluded the remaining failures now point at legacy boss/entity implementations (e.g. `stellar_avatar`) and other gameplay systems queued for later tasks.
- Added a temporary TerraBlender region registration (`forge/src/main/java/com/netroaki/chex/terrablender/CHEXTerraBlender.java`) and call it from `CHEX` so the biome pipeline still flows through TerraBlender even while planet biomes are stubbed.
