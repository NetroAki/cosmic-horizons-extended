# Arrakis Flora Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation details for the Arrakis flora, including Spice Cactus, Ice Reeds, and Desert Shrubs. These plants are essential for the Arrakis dimension and provide valuable resources for players.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Spice Cactus

- **Growth Logic**: Grows through 4 stages, with each stage increasing in height
- **Drops**: Spice Cactus item, Sticks (when mature)
- **Behavior**: Grows on sand/terracotta, emits light when mature
- **Usage**: Can be smelted into Dried Spice

### 2. Ice Reeds

- **Growth Logic**: Grows through 8 stages in waterlogged conditions
- **Drops**: Ice Reeds item, Ice (when mature)
- **Behavior**: Grows on ice blocks, prefers waterlogged conditions
- **Usage**: Can be crafted into Packed Ice

### 3. Desert Shrubs

- **Growth Logic**: Grows through 3 stages and can spread to adjacent blocks
- **Drops**: Desert Shrub item, Sticks, Yellow Dye (when mature)
- **Behavior**: Grows on sand/terracotta, spreads naturally
- **Usage**: Can be crafted into Yellow Dye

## World Generation

- **Great Dunes Biome**: Spice Cactus and Desert Shrubs
- **Polar Ice Caps**: Ice Reeds
- **Spice Mines**: Spice Cactus

## Testing Notes

- Verify growth mechanics in different biomes
- Test harvesting and resource collection
- Check world generation in new chunks
- Verify crafting/smelting recipes

## Known Issues

- None identified during implementation

## Future Improvements

- Add more visual variety to plant models
- Consider adding more interactions with existing game mechanics
- Add particle effects for special states (e.g., when Spice Cactus is mature)
