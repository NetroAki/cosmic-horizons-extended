# Aqua Mundus Blocks Implementation

## Overview

Implemented the block set for the Aqua Mundus dimension, including vent basalt, manganese nodules, luminous kelp, and ice shelf slabs.

## Blocks Added

### 1. Vent Basalt

- A dark, porous volcanic rock that forms around hydrothermal vents
- Emits a faint glow to indicate heat
- Found in hydrothermal vent biomes

### 2. Manganese Nodule

- Metallic mineral deposits found on the ocean floor
- Can be mined for manganese and other rare metals
- Generates in clusters in deep ocean biomes

### 3. Luminous Kelp

- Glowing underwater plant that grows in tall stalks
- Emits a soft blue bioluminescent light
- Has a glowing variant that appears at night or in dark areas
- Can be used for underwater lighting

### 4. Ice Shelf Slab

- Slippery, translucent ice blocks that form floating platforms
- Can be waterlogged
- Slower to melt than regular ice
- Used for building in cold biomes

## Technical Implementation

- Created custom block classes for each block type
- Implemented special behaviors:
  - Luminous kelp growth and glowing mechanics
  - Ice shelf slab waterlogging and slipperiness
  - Proper block properties and states
- Added complete model and blockstate JSON files
- Set up proper rendering types (translucent, cutout, etc.)

## Assets Created

- Block models and textures (placeholders)
- Blockstate definitions
- Loot tables
- Language entries

## Next Steps

1. Create actual textures for all blocks
2. Add block drops and recipes
3. Implement world generation for each block type
4. Add particle effects for vent basalt and luminous kelp

## Notes

- All blocks are properly registered in the mod's block registry
- Block properties are balanced for gameplay
- Models use vanilla block models as parents where possible for consistency
- All JSON files follow Minecraft's resource pack format
