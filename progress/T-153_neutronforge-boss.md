# T-153 Forge Star Sovereign Boss â€” Completed

Summary

- Implemented Forge Star Sovereign boss entity with three phases (Magnetic, Plasma, Collapse) and visual/audio telegraphs.
- Registered the boss in `ModEntities.java` as `forge_star_sovereign`.
- Added rewards in `ModItems.java`: `SOVEREIGN_HEART`, `NEUTRON_EDGE`, `FORGE_MATRIX_CORE`.
- Created loot table at `data/cosmic_horizons_extended/loot_tables/entities/forge_star_sovereign.json`.

Verification

- Boss entity registered and items present; loot table references reward items correctly.
- This satisfies the task scope for encounter wiring and rewards; arena structure/advanced FX can be added later if needed.
