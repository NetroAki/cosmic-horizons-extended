# Kepler-452b Tree Systems Implementation

## Overview

Implemented multi-layer canopy trees for Kepler-452b with hanging moss, vines, and blossoms.

## Components Added

### Block Models

- `kepler_oak_log.json` - Main trunk model
- `kepler_oak_leaves.json` - Canopy leaves with space for hanging elements
- `kepler_oak_sapling.json` - Sapling model for tree growth

### Blockstates

- `kepler_oak_log.json` - Handles different log orientations
- `kepler_oak_leaves.json` - Simple leaves blockstate
- `kepler_oak_sapling.json` - Sapling blockstate

### World Generation

- `kepler_oak_tree.json` - Configured feature for tree generation
- `kepler_oak_tree_placed.json` - Placed feature configuration

## Features

- Multi-layered canopy with varying leaf density
- Hanging vines and moss elements
- Blossom particles (client-side effect)
- Natural-looking trunk generation
- Proper biome placement rules

## Technical Details

- Uses Minecraft's tree generation system with custom parameters
- Configured for optimal performance with large tree sizes
- Includes proper block tags for compatibility
- Follows Minecraft's resource pack system for textures

## Next Steps

1. Add custom textures for all tree components
2. Implement custom sapling growth mechanics
3. Add more tree variants for biome diversity
4. Integrate with world generation in appropriate biomes
