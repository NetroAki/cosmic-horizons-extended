# Step 15 - Remote Agent Quickstart (2025-09-21)

- Ran `git fetch` to ensure the local worktree knows about the latest upstream refs without merging.
- Authored `agents.md` capturing the condensed workflow for cloud Codex agents (setup order, formatting rules, task logging cadence, validation expectations).
- No code changes to gameplay systems; next steps remain addressing the outstanding build errors (PlanetOverrides/Core, fluid buckets, TerraBlender region constants).
