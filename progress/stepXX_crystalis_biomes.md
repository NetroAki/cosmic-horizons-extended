# Step XX: Crystalis Biomes Implementation

## Overview

Implemented the following biomes for the Crystalis dimension:

1. **Diamond Fields** - Expansive plains with exposed diamond formations and crystalline structures
2. **Frosted Plains** - Vast icy plains with snow cover and sparse vegetation
3. **Cryo Geysers** - Geothermal areas with steam vents, hot springs, and unique mineral deposits
4. **Ice Cliffs** - Towering ice formations, deep crevasses, and frozen waterfalls
5. **Pressure Depths** - Deep underwater caverns with high pressure zones and unique crystal formations

## Technical Details

### Biome Configuration

- Set appropriate temperature and precipitation values for each biome (-0.5 to -1.2 temperature, 0.3-0.8 downfall)
- Configured unique fog and water colors for each biome type
- Added custom particle effects for atmosphere
- Implemented appropriate sound effects and background music
- Set up proper carvers and features for each biome type

### Features

- Diamond ore generation in Diamond Fields
- Ice and snow features in Frosted Plains and Ice Cliffs
- Geothermal features in Cryo Geysers
- Underwater cave systems in Pressure Depths
- Custom particle effects and ambient sounds

## Testing

- Verified biome generation in-game
- Confirmed proper temperature and precipitation effects
- Tested transitions between biomes
- Verified sound and particle effects

## Next Steps

- Add custom flora and fauna (T-082)
- Implement unique structures and features (T-081)
- Add environmental hazards (T-084)
