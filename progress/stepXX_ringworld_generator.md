# Ringworld Generator & Wrap Hooks (T-100)

## Summary

- Implemented an initial Ringworld chunk generator scaffold that creates flat longitudinal strips with a simple zoning function based on world X and a configurable `strip_period`.
- The generator exposes a `CODEC` for data-driven configuration and supports future iteration for gravity bands, wrap hooks, and zoning.

## Files Added

- forge/src/main/java/com/netroaki/chex/world/ringworld/RingworldChunkGenerator.java

## Notes

- This is a minimal generator to wire in registration and iterate worldgen logic. Follow-ups can:
  - Map strip indices to biome zones (Ice Fields, Dust Belts, Meadows, Shadowed Rims, etc.).
  - Add explicit wrap hooks and gravity band metadata.
  - Integrate with noise router and features for terrain variety.
