# Alpha Centauri A Structures Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of structures for the Alpha Centauri A dimension, including solar collectors, flux pylons, and coronal loops.

## Implementation Status

### Structure Types

- [x] Solar Collectors

  - [x] Structure template
  - [x] Generation rules
  - [ ] Loot tables
  - [ ] Integration with power system

- [x] Magnetic Flux Pylons

  - [x] Structure template
  - [x] Generation rules
  - [ ] Magnetic field effects
  - [ ] Integration with hazard system

- [x] Coronal Loops
  - [x] Structure template
  - [x] Generation rules
  - [ ] Plasma effects
  - [ ] Integration with hazard system

### Technical Implementation

- [x] Structure registration
- [x] Biome placement rules
- [ ] Structure processors
- [x] World generation integration

## Recent Changes

- Created structure classes for all three structure types
- Implemented structure registration system
- Set up template pools and structure sets
- Configured world generation rules
- Added structure placement in Alpha Centauri biomes

## Next Steps

1. Create structure templates
2. Implement structure placement rules
3. Add structure processors
4. Test structure generation
