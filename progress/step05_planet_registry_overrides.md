# T-005 Planet Registry Overrides Implementation

## Changes Made

1. **Updated PlanetOverridesCore**

   - Enhanced the `Entry` class to support all fields from `PlanetDef`
   - Improved JSON parsing to handle the flat structure of `chex-planets.json5`
   - Added proper null-safety and type conversion for all fields
   - Added support for parsing string arrays for hazards and available minerals

2. **Enhanced PlanetOverrideMerger**

   - Updated the merge logic to handle all fields from the updated `Entry` class
   - Added support for fallback to suit tier if suit tag is not provided
   - Improved handling of optional fields with proper fallbacks to base values
   - Added validation for numeric ranges (e.g., rocket tier, gravity level)

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added better error messages for malformed JSON
   - Added validation for required fields
   - Added proper null checks throughout the code

## Testing

1. **Unit Tests**

   - Added tests for parsing different field combinations
   - Verified proper handling of edge cases (null values, empty strings, etc.)
   - Tested merging behavior with various override scenarios

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Verified that planet overrides are correctly applied in-game
   - Confirmed that the original planet data remains unchanged when no overrides are present
   - Tested with various combinations of overridden fields

## Next Steps

1. **Documentation**

   - Update documentation to reflect the new fields and their usage
   - Add examples of valid override configurations

2. **Performance Optimization**

   - Consider caching parsed overrides to improve load times
   - Optimize string operations and object creation

3. **Validation**
   - Add validation for biome types against the game's registry
   - Verify that referenced resources (e.g., fuel types) exist
