# T-034 Arrakis Flora Implementation

## Overview
Implemented the unique flora of Arrakis, including spice cacti, ice reeds, and desert shrubs. These plants are specially adapted to the harsh desert environment and provide essential resources for survival and crafting.

## Flora Implementations

### 1. Spice Cactus (Arrakis Cactaceae)
- **Description**: Tall, spiny cacti that store water and produce Spice Melange in their roots
- **Growth**: Grows in stages, reaching up to 3 blocks tall
- **Properties**:
  - Deals damage on contact
  - Requires minimal water
  - Drops Spice Melange when mature
  - Can be harvested with shears for Cactus Flesh

### 2. Ice Reeds (Cryoarundinaceae)
- **Description**: Tall, crystalline reeds that condense atmospheric moisture
- **Growth**: Grows in shallow water or moist sand
- **Properties**:
  - Generates water particles when mature
  - Can be crafted into paper or woven into cloth
  - Drops Ice Reed Fibers when broken

### 3. Desert Shrubs (Xerophyta arrakis)
- **Description**: Hardy, low-growing shrubs with deep roots
- **Growth**: Spreads slowly across sand
- **Properties**:
  - Prevents sand from becoming unstable
  - Can be harvested for Fiber Leaves
  - Attracts small desert creatures

## Technical Implementation

### Block Classes
- `SpiceCactusBlock`: Custom cactus variant with Spice Melange production
- `IceReedBlock`: Water-condensing plant with particle effects
- `DesertShrubBlock`: Ground-cover plant with spreading behavior

### Growth Logic
- **Spice Cactus**: Grows upward in stages, producing Spice Melange in its base block
- **Ice Reeds**: Requires adjacent water source, grows faster at night
- **Desert Shrubs**: Spreads to adjacent sand blocks over time

### Loot Tables
- Added drops for all growth stages
- Special shearing behavior for Spice Cactus
- Compostable plant materials

### Integration
- Compatible with Forge's crop growth events
- Works with Bone Meal for accelerated growth
- Supports right-click harvesting

## Textures & Models
- Created high-resolution textures (256x)
- Animated textures for Ice Reed condensation
- Variant models for different growth stages

## Testing
- [ ] Verify growth mechanics in different biomes
- [ ] Test harvesting and replanting
- [ ] Check compatibility with other mods
- [ ] Verify loot table drops

## Future Work
1. Add more plant variants
2. Implement cross-breeding mechanics
3. Add more uses for plant byproducts
4. Create decorative variants for building
