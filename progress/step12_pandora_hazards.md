## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the Pandora dimension's hazards and audio systems, including environmental hazards, ambient sounds, and creature sound effects.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Hazard System

- **Levitation Updrafts**: Added floating island updrafts that affect players without proper protection
- **Heat Aura**: Implemented heat damage in volcanic biomes
- **Spore Blindness**: Added spore clouds that can blind players in fungal biomes
- **Suit Protection**: Integrated with the existing suit system to provide protection against hazards

### 2. Ambient Audio System

- **Biome-Specific Ambience**: Added unique ambient sounds for different Pandora biomes
- **Dynamic Sound Events**: Implemented dynamic sound selection based on player location and conditions
