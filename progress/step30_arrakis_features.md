# Arrakis Feature Generation - Task T-033

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of world generation features for the Arrakis dimension in the Cosmic Horizons Expanded mod. The task involved creating various terrain features including dunes, spice geysers, sandworm tunnels, polar ice formations, and storm crystal shards.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Dune Ridges

- **Location**: Great Dunes biome
- **Description**: Natural sand and sandstone formations that create the iconic dune landscape of Arrakis
- **Implementation**:
  - Uses noise-based placement for natural-looking dune patterns
  - Combines different types of sandstone for varied appearance
  - Configured with appropriate density and spread parameters

### 2. Spice Geysers

- **Location**: Spice Mines and Great Dunes biomes
- **Description**: Erupting geysers that release valuable spice particles into the air
- **Implementation**:
  - Custom geode-like structure with spice deposits at the core
  - Multi-layered with different block types for visual interest
  - Configured with appropriate rarity and placement parameters

### 3. Sandworm Tunnels

- **Location**: Underground in all Arrakis biomes
- **Description**: Massive underground tunnels created by the movement of sandworms
- **Implementation**:
  - Large, winding cave systems with smooth walls
  - Occasional spice deposits along tunnel walls
  - Configured with appropriate depth and frequency

### 4. Polar Ice Formations

- **Location**: Polar Ice Caps biome
- **Description**: Towering ice formations and frozen structures
- **Implementation**:
  - Uses packed ice and blue ice blocks for visual variety
  - Configured with appropriate height and density parameters
  - Includes surface and underground ice features

### 5. Storm Crystal Shards

- **Location**: Stormlands and Polar Ice Caps biomes
- **Description**: Glowing crystal formations that grow in storm-affected areas
- **Implementation**:
  - Small clusters of glowing crystal blocks
  - Configured with appropriate light levels and growth patterns
  - Spawns in specific biomes with controlled density

## Technical Implementation

### Configured Features

- Created JSON files for each feature type in `worldgen/configured_feature/`
- Configured appropriate block types, sizes, and generation rules
- Implemented noise-based placement for natural-looking distribution

### Placed Features

- Created placement configurations in `worldgen/placed_feature/`
- Set up biome-specific generation rules
- Configured rarity, density, and height parameters

### Biome Integration

- Updated biome JSON files to include the new features
- Ensured proper feature distribution across different biomes
- Balanced generation parameters for optimal gameplay experience

## Testing

- [ ] Verify dune generation in Great Dunes biome
- [ ] Test spice geyser generation and particle effects
- [ ] Check sandworm tunnel generation and connectivity
- [ ] Verify polar ice formations in Polar Ice Caps
- [ ] Test storm crystal shard generation and lighting

## Next Steps

1. Test feature generation in-game
2. Adjust generation parameters based on testing
3. Document feature configurations and usage
4. Create any additional supporting assets (particles, sounds, etc.)

## Notes

- All features are designed to work with the existing Arrakis biomes
- Generation parameters may need adjustment based on world testing
- Some features may require additional block states or properties for full functionality
