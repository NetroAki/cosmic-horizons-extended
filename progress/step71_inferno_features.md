# T-071 Inferno Prime Features Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of various features for the Inferno Prime dimension, including magma geysers, basalt pillars, obsidian flora, ash dunes, and falling ash particles.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Magma Geysers

- Created `MagmaGeyserFeature` class for generating magma geyser structures
- Added block registration for magma geyser blocks
- Configured world generation in appropriate biomes (Lava Seas, Magma Caverns)

### 2. Basalt Pillars

- Implemented `BasaltPillarFeature` for generating basalt pillar structures
- Added block variants and decorations
- Integrated with Basalt Flats and other appropriate biomes

### 3. Obsidian Flora

- Created `ObsidianFloraFeature` for generating obsidian spikes and thorn vines
- Implemented block behaviors and interactions
- Added to Obsidian Isles and Ash Wastes biomes

### 4. Ash Dunes

- Implemented `AshDunesFeature` for generating ash dune terrain
- Added ash block variants and transitions
- Configured in Ash Wastes biome

### 5. Falling Ash Particles

- Created custom `AshParticle` class with proper rendering
- Implemented `AshParticleHandler` for client-side particle effects
- Added biome-appropriate particle density and behaviors

## Technical Details

### World Generation

- Used Minecraft's feature system with custom configured and placed features
- Implemented proper biome filtering and rarity controls
- Ensured compatibility with existing terrain generation

### Performance Considerations

- Optimized particle effects with distance-based culling
- Implemented feature placement restrictions to prevent overcrowding
- Used appropriate block states and models for performance

## Testing

- Verified feature generation in all target biomes
- Tested particle effects and performance impact
- Confirmed proper integration with existing content

## Remaining Work

- Final balance testing in-game
- Potential performance optimizations based on testing
- Additional polish and tweaks as needed

## Next Steps

1. Proceed with T-072 for implementing Inferno Prime fauna
2. Continue testing and balancing based on player feedback
3. Prepare for integration with the progression system
