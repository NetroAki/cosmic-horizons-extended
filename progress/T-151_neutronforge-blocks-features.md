# T-151 Neutron Star Forge Blocks & Features â€” Completed

Summary

- Registered Neutron block families in `ModBlocks.java`: accretion_rock, plasma_glass, magnetite_alloy_block, charge_crystal, forge_alloy_block, furnace_node, neutron_stone, strangelet_block, radiation_alloy, shield_panel.
- Authored blockstate and model assets for all new blocks so they render.
- Implemented worldgen features and wiring:
  - Configured features: `neutron_charge_crystal_cluster`, `neutron_shield_panel_patch`
  - Placed features: `neutron_charge_crystal_cluster_placed`, `neutron_shield_panel_patch_placed`
  - Biome modifiers: add charge crystals to Magnetar Belts; shield panels to Radiation Shelters.

Verification

- Data pack JSONs follow standard formats. Features are referenced by placed features and injected via biome modifiers.
- Acceptance criteria satisfied for visible blocks and initial feature population.

Notes

- Additional features (plasma vents, magnetic storms, platform details) can be layered later. Lighting levels and counts are placeholders for balancing.
