# Alpha Centauri A Hazard Systems Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of hazard systems for the Alpha Centauri A dimension, including extreme light/heat hazards and solar flare events.

## Implementation Status

### Hazard Systems

- [x] Base hazard effect implementation
- [x] Suit tier protection
- [x] Visual effects (heat distortion, light flares)
- [x] Audio cues
- [x] Particle effects

### Solar Flare Events

- [x] Flare event system
- [x] Warning system
- [x] Damage mechanics
- [x] Visual/audio effects

### Integration

- [x] Biome-specific hazard levels
- [x] Player feedback (HUD, sounds)
- [x] Configuration options

## Recent Changes

- Implemented RadiationEffect with suit tier protection
- Created SolarFlareManager for dynamic flare events
- Added hazard detection and effect application
- Integrated with existing suit tier system
- Added visual/audio feedback for hazards
- Implemented player warnings and notifications

## Next Steps

1. Implement base hazard effects
2. Add solar flare event system
3. Create visual and audio feedback
4. Test and balance hazard mechanics
