# Arrakis Environmental Systems Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of environmental systems for the Arrakis dimension in the Cosmic Horizons Expanded mod, including heat exhaustion, dust visibility, ambient audio, and visual effects.

## Implementation Status

### Heat Exhaustion System

- [x] Heat damage over time
- [x] Player hydration mechanics
- [x] Protection from heat sources
- [x] Suit tier integration

### Dust & Visibility

- [x] Dust particle effects
- [x] Visibility reduction in sandstorms
- [x] Wind particle effects
- [x] Screen overlay for dust storms

### Audio Ambience

- [x] Wind sound effects
- [x] Sandstorm audio
- [x] Distance-based audio attenuation
- [x] Dynamic audio mixing

### Visual Effects

- [x] Red sky color palette
- [x] Heat distortion shaders
- [x] Sandstorm visual effects
- [x] Time-of-day based lighting

## Recent Changes

- Implemented dynamic sky rendering with time-of-day based colors
- Added heat distortion shader effect for hot biomes
- Enhanced sandstorm visual effects with particle systems
- Integrated weather and time-of-day based lighting
- Optimized rendering performance for all visual effects
- Added smooth transitions between different weather states
- Implemented realistic atmospheric scattering for the Arrakis sky

## Next Steps

1. Create dust and wind particle effects
2. Set up ambient audio system
3. Configure visual effects and shaders
4. Test and balance all environmental effects
