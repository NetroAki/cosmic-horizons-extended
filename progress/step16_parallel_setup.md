# Step 16 - Parallel Agent Scaffolding (2025-09-21)

- Created tasks/2025-09-21/ with four focused task specs (T-001..T-004) for PlanetDef alignment, fluid buckets, TerraBlender updates, and JSON tooling.
- Added claims/ directory plus notes/INBOX.md and progress/HANDOFF.md placeholders to coordinate parallel sessions.
- Authored scripts/spawn_task_branches.sh to spawn feature branches + claim files, and stubbed scripts/validate_json.py referenced by AGENTS.md.
