# Alpha Centauri A Dimension Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of the Alpha Centauri A dimension in the Cosmic Horizons Expanded mod, including the photosphere platforms, corona streams, magnetosphere belt, sunspot fields, and solar arrays biomes.

## Implementation Status

### Dimension Setup

- [x] Dimension type configuration
- [x] Noise settings
- [x] Chunk generator
- [x] Dimension renderer

### Biomes

- [x] Photosphere Platforms
- [x] Corona Streams
- [ ] Magnetosphere Belt
- [ ] Sunspot Fields
- [ ] Solar Arrays

### Features

- [ ] Plasma geysers
- [ ] Magnetic flux tubes
- [ ] Solar prominences
