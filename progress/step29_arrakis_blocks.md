# Arrakis Block Set Implementation - Task T-032

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the Arrakis block set for the Cosmic Horizons Expanded mod. The task involved creating various blocks for different Arrakis biomes, including Spice Mines, Sietch Strongholds, and Stormlands.

## Blocks Implemented

### Spice Mine Blocks

- **Spice Deposit**: A glowing mineral formation found in Spice Mines

  - Properties: Glowing (light level 4), amethyst-like sound
  - Strength: 1.2 (slightly harder than stone)
  - Used for: Decoration, light sources, crafting material

- **Crystalline Salt Cluster**: Decorative crystal formations
  - Properties: Quartz-like appearance with amethyst cluster sounds
  - Strength: 0.8 (slightly fragile)
  - Used for: Decoration, crafting material

### Sietch Stronghold Blocks

- **Sietch Stone**: Basic building material

  - Properties: Similar to stone bricks but stronger (1.8 hardness)
  - Used for: Structural elements in Sietch Strongholds

- **Sietch Stone Bricks**: Decorative variant

  - Properties: Clean, refined look with 2.0 hardness
  - Used for: Walls, floors, and decorative elements

- **Sietch Stone Chiseled**: Ornamental variant
  - Properties: Intricate patterns, 2.0 hardness
  - Used for: Decorative accents and important structures

### Stormlands Blocks

- **Stormglass**: Glass-like material formed by sandstorms

  - Properties: Clear with a slight tint, 0.8 hardness
  - Used for: Windows, decorative elements

- **Hardened Dune Sand**: Compacted sand

  - Properties: Similar to sandstone but stronger (1.5 hardness)
  - Used for: Building material in harsh environments

- **Sandstorm Glass**: Tinted, weather-resistant glass
  - Properties: Opaque, 1.0 hardness
  - Used for: Windows in Stormlands structures

## Technical Implementation

### Block Registration

- All blocks are registered in `CHEXBlocks.java`
- Proper block properties set for each block type
- Appropriate sound types and light levels configured
- Block items registered for all blocks

### Block Properties

- **Hardness**: Ranges from 0.8 (fragile crystals) to 2.0 (reinforced stone)
- **Light Levels**: Glowing blocks have appropriate light emission
- **Sound Types**: Custom sounds for different material types
- **Mob Spawning**: Non-spawnable blocks marked with `isValidSpawn`

## Next Steps

1. Create block models and textures
2. Implement loot tables for block drops
3. Add crafting and smelting recipes
4. Test block placement and interactions
5. Document block properties and usage

## Testing

- [ ] Verify block placement and breaking
- [ ] Test light emission from glowing blocks
- [ ] Check block interactions with tools
- [ ] Verify proper rendering of all blocks
