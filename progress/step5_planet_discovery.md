# Step 5 - Cosmic Horizons Discovery Sync (2025-09-21)

Deliverables:

- Added runtime reload path for discovered Cosmic Horizons planets (PlanetRegistry.java) with logging table and snapshot clearing.
- Fallback entries updated to cosmos:earth_moon, cosmos:mercury_wasteland, cosmos:marslands so runtime aligns with CH namespace list.
- Server startup discovery now calls PlanetRegistry.reloadDiscoveredPlanets() after writing \_discovered_planets.json (PlanetDiscovery.java).
- Captured integration notes in
  otes/planet_discovery_pipeline.md.

Next: confirm log output/table during next server spin-up and check TODO list for subsequent items (dimension datapack scaffolding).
