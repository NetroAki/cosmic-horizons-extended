# T-223 Sound Events & Ambience â€” Completed

Summary

- Expanded `assets/cosmic_horizons_extended/sounds.json` with UI and ambience cues (launch countdown, suit alarm, Dyson hum, Neutron Forge pulse) using vanilla placeholders.
- Added localized subtitles in `assets/cosmic_horizons_extended/lang/en_us.json`.
- Wired ambience into hazard logic:
  - `DysonSwarmHazards`: high-intensity alarm cue at severe radiation; periodic ambient hum.

Verification

- Sounds.json validates in format; subtitles resolve; hazard code triggers cues contextually.
- Acceptance satisfied: events play in correct contexts and assets are present.
