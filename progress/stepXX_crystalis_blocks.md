## Technical Details

### Block Registration

- Created `CrystalisBlocks` class with proper registration methods
- Implemented block properties including:
  - Hardness and blast resistance
  - Light emission for glowing blocks
  - Transparency settings for translucent blocks
  - Friction values for icy surfaces

### Models and Blockstates

- Created JSON models for all blocks
- Set up proper render types for translucent blocks
- Added item models for all blocks
- Configured blockstates for all blocks

### Integration

- Registered blocks with the main mod class
- Ensured proper creative tab assignment
- Set up proper block item registration

## Testing

- [ ] Verify all blocks appear in-game
- [ ] Test block properties (hardness, blast resistance)
- [ ] Verify light emission works as expected
- [ ] Test transparency and rendering

## Next Steps

- Add block loot tables
- Create block tags for world generation
- Add recipes for craftable blocks
- Implement any special block behaviors
