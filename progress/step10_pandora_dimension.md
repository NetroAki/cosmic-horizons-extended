## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of the Pandora dimension for the Cosmic Horizons Expanded mod. The goal is to create a unique and immersive experience with twilight gradient, levitation pockets, and dense atmosphere effects.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Dimension Configuration
- [x] Created `pandora_effects.json` with custom dimension effects
- [x] Updated `pandora.json` with enhanced visual and audio settings
- [x] Configured perpetual twilight with `fixed_time: 18000`
- [x] Added ambient lighting and mood sounds

### 2. Visual Effects
- [x] Implemented twilight gradient with custom sky colors
- [x] Added glowing particle effects for bioluminescent elements
- [x] Configured dense atmospheric fog with custom density settings
- [x] Set up custom water colors for the alien environment

### 3. Gameplay Mechanics
- [x] Added levitation pockets with configurable properties:
  - Frequency: 1% chance per chunk
  - Radius: 3-8 blocks
  - Strength: 0.5-1.5
- [x] Implemented dense atmosphere with:
  - Increased air resistance (0.7)
  - Movement slowness (0.3)
  - Custom fog density (1.2)

### 4. Audio Design
- [x] Added ambient cave sounds

## Testing Instructions
1. Travel to the Pandora dimension using `/execute in cosmic_horizons_extended:pandora run tp @s 0 100 0`
2. Verify:
   - Twilight gradient in the sky
   - Levitation when moving through certain areas
   - Dense atmosphere effects on movement
   - Custom water and fog colors
   - Ambient sounds and music

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Test performance with various render distances
