# T-032 Arrakis Block Set Implementation

## Overview
Implemented the block set for the Arrakis dimension, including arrakite sandstone variants, spice nodes, crystalline salt, ash stone, dune glass, and sietch structures. These blocks capture the harsh desert planet aesthetic while providing unique gameplay elements.

## Block Implementations

### 1. Arrakite Sandstone Variants
- **Arrakite Sandstone**: Base building block with a dark, wind-worn texture
- **Chiseled Arrakite Sandstone**: Decorative variant with Fremen symbols
- **Smooth Arrakite Sandstone**: Polished variant for construction
- **Arrakite Sandstone Stairs & Slabs**: Building variants for all sandstone types

### 2. Spice Node
- Generates in the deep desert biomes
- Glows faintly at night
- Drops Spice Melange when harvested
- Emits spice particles when broken

### 3. Crystalline Salt
- Forms in salt flats and near underground water pockets
- Can be processed into table salt or used for preservation
- Has a subtle shimmer effect

### 4. Ash Stone
- Volcanic rock found in the deep desert
- Used in Fremen construction
- Has higher blast resistance than normal stone

### 5. Dune Glass
- Made from melted sand
- Provides UV protection while allowing visibility
- Used in moisture vaporators and sietch windows

### 6. Sietch Structures
- **Sietchrock**: Main building material for Fremen structures
- **Sietchwood**: Rare wood-like material from underground fungi
- **Sietch Fabric**: Woven material for tents and partitions

## Technical Implementation

### Block Properties
- **Hardness & Resistance**: Balanced for survival gameplay
- **Sounds**: Custom sound types for different materials
- **Light Levels**: Some blocks emit subtle light
- **Tags**: Added appropriate block and item tags for compatibility

### Data Generation
- Block states and models
- Item models
- Loot tables
- Recipes for crafting and smelting
- Tags for compatibility with other mods

### Textures
- Created high-resolution textures (256x)
- Normal and specular maps for PBR support
- Particle effects for special blocks

## Integration
- Compatible with TerraBlender for world generation
- Works with existing mods like JEI and The One Probe
- Supports dynamic lighting mods

## Testing
- [ ] Verify block generation in different biomes
- [ ] Test all crafting/smelting recipes
- [ ] Check block interactions (redstone, pistons, etc.)
- [ ] Verify tool requirements and harvest levels

## Future Work
1. Add more decorative variants
2. Implement special block behaviors (like moisture collection)
3. Add more Fremen-themed decorative blocks
4. Create more advanced crafting recipes
