# Arrakis Dimension Setup - Task T-030

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the Arrakis dimension in Cosmic Horizons Expanded. The task involved creating the dimension JSON and dimension type files with appropriate settings for a harsh desert environment with sandstorms and reduced water.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Arrakis Dimension Type

- Created `dimension_type/arrakis.json` with settings optimized for a desert environment
- Set `ultrawarm: true` to reduce water evaporation
- Configured ambient light and fixed time to create constant daylight
- Disabled beds to prevent exploits
- Set appropriate monster spawn light levels for desert conditions

### 2. Updated Arrakis Dimension Configuration

- Configured `dimension/arrakis.json` with desert-appropriate settings:
  - Bright sky color (12632319) for intense sunlight
  - Warm fog color (13224374) for hazy atmosphere
  - Darkened water colors to represent scarce, valuable water
  - Sand-colored particle effects for dust storms
  - High ambient light (0.8) for harsh desert sun
  - Fixed time at noon (6000) for constant extreme heat
  - Added desert-appropriate sound effects and music

### 3. Biome Integration

- Connected to the `arrakis_great_dunes` biome as the default biome
- Set up the dimension to use custom noise settings for desert terrain
- Configured the dimension to use the Nether's infiniburn behavior for consistency with other dimensions

## Technical Details

- **Dimension Type**: `cosmic_horizons_extended:arrakis`
- **Noise Settings**: `cosmic_horizons_extended:arrakis`
- **Biome Source**: `cosmic_horizons_extended:arrakis`
- **Default Biome**: `cosmic_horizons_extended:arrakis_great_dunes`
- **Infiniburn Tag**: `minecraft:infiniburn_nether`

## Testing

- [ ] Verify dimension loads correctly in-game
- [ ] Check that sandstorm effects are visible
- [ ] Confirm water behaves as expected (reduced amounts, quick evaporation)
- [ ] Test mob spawning in different light levels

## Next Steps

1. Implement sandstorm weather effects
2. Add custom water behavior for Arrakis
3. Create additional biomes (rocky wastes, deep desert, polar sink)
4. Implement spice blow mechanics
5. Add sandworm spawning and behavior
