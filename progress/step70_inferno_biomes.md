### Technical Implementation

- [x] Biome JSON configurations created
- [x] Climate settings configured for each biome

## Next Steps

1. Implement custom features (magma geysers, obsidian spikes, etc.)
2. Add custom structures (volcanoes, ruined fortresses)
3. Create custom mobs (ash crawlers, fire wraiths, magma hoppers)
4. Implement unique resources and ores
5. Add biome-specific advancements and loot tables

## Notes

- All biomes are designed to work with the Nether's existing generation
- Temperature and humidity values are balanced for proper biome placement
- Spawn rates and creature distributions are subject to playtesting
- Additional features may be added based on gameplay feedback
