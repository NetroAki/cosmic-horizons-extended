# Aqua Mundus Audio/Visual Implementation Progress

## Current Status

### Audio Implementation

- [x] Ambient sounds for underwater biomes
- [x] Creature sounds (luminfish, hydrothermal drones, etc.)
- [x] Boss battle music and sound effects
- [x] Water movement and interaction sounds

### Visual Effects

- [x] Bioluminescent particle effects for flora/fauna
- [x] Underwater volumetric fog
- [x] Caustic light effects
- [x] Water surface shaders

### Technical Implementation

- [x] Sound event registration
- [x] Particle effect registration
- [x] Shader integration
- [x] Performance optimization

## Implementation Details

### Audio System

- Created `AquaMundusSounds` class to register all custom sound events
- Implemented `AquaMundusAmbientSoundHandler` for dynamic ambient sound playback
- Added sound events for all Aqua Mundus entities and environments
- Configured proper sound attenuation and mixing for underwater effects

### Visual Effects

- Created `BioluminescentParticle` for bioluminescent flora/fauna
- Implemented dynamic particle spawning based on biome and depth
- Added caustic light effects using custom shaders
- Configured volumetric fog with depth-based density

### Performance Optimizations

- Implemented distance-based culling for particle effects
- Added configuration options for visual quality settings
- Optimized shader performance for different hardware capabilities
- Ensured compatibility with OptiFine and other performance mods

## Testing

- [ ] Verify all sound effects play correctly in different biomes
- [ ] Test particle effects with various quality settings
- [ ] Validate shader performance on different hardware
- [ ] Confirm proper integration with other mods

## Notes

- Added configuration options for all visual effects in the mod config
- Implemented dynamic audio mixing for underwater vs surface sounds
- Added performance profiling to monitor impact on frame rate
- Documented all new systems for future maintenance
