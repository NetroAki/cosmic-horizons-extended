# Step 1 - Context Review (2025-09-21)

- Reviewed PROJECT_CONTEXT.md to refresh scope: CHEX mod extends Cosmic Horizons with planets Pandora & Arrakis, 10 biomes, 15+ blocks, TerraBlender integration, GTCEu hooks.
- Key active areas: Boss system, mineral distribution, client UI, sound work still pending.
- Reference documents to consult next: TB_STRATEGY.md, Cosmic_Horizons_Addon_Support_Consolidated.md, planet design docs, block JSONs.
- Next action: choose a concrete feature milestone (block, biome, system) that aligns with in-progress/planned items.
