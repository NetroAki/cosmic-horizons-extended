# Step 8 - Planet Detail Integration (2025-09-21)

- Merged content from Planet Design doc and Research into CHEX_DETAILED_TASKS.md, ensuring every planet has explicit TODOs for blocks, flora, fauna, structures, bosses, hazards, GTCEu ties, and audio/visual polish.
- Added tier progression context (boss cores, suit hazards, mineral mapping) to the roadmap.
- Next action: prioritize Pandora (Section 2.1) dimension + assets as initial implementation target.
