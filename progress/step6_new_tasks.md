# Step 6 - Detailed Task Plan Drafted (2025-09-21)

- Created CHEX_DETAILED_TASKS.md summarizing actionable TODOs across dimensions, worldgen, progression, UX, audio, docs, and QA.
- Tasks cross-reference key classes (PlanetRegistry, TravelGraph, FuelRegistry) and resource paths (data/cosmic_horizons_extended/...).
- Next action: review with project owner, then begin executing Section 2 (dimension datapacks).
