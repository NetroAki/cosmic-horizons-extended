# Pandora Block Set Implementation

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of Pandora's block set, including pandorite variants, spore soil, biolume moss, crystal-clad pandorite, lumicoral, and volcanic/ash blocks.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Block Registrations

Added the following blocks to `CHEXBlocks.java`:

- Pandorite variants (stone, cobbled, bricks, mossy, polished)
- Spore soil for fungal growth
- Biolume moss with bioluminescent properties
- Lumicoral blocks for ocean biomes
- Crystal-clad pandorite variants

### 2. Textures and Assets

- Created placeholder textures for all new blocks
- Organized block textures in the assets directory
- Ensured proper texture mapping for all block variants

### 3. Block Properties

- Set appropriate hardness and resistance values
- Configured light levels for bioluminescent blocks
- Added proper sound types and material properties

## Testing

- [ ] Verify block placement and breaking mechanics
- [ ] Test light emission from bioluminescent blocks
- [ ] Check block interactions (spreading, growth, etc.)
- [ ] Validate rendering in different environments

## Next Steps

1. Implement block loot tables
2. Add crafting and smelting recipes
3. Create block tags for world generation
4. Add block state JSONs for special rendering
5. Document block properties in the wiki
