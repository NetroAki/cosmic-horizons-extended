- [x] **Shardlings** - Small hostile mobs in Crystal Canyons
- [x] **Frost Hares** - Passive mobs in Frosted Plains
- [x] **Ice Stalkers** - Hostile mobs in Frosted Peaks
- [x] **Mist Wraiths** - Hostile flying mobs in Misty Chasms
- [x] **Vent Crawlers** - Hostile mobs near thermal vents

- [x] **Abyss Drifters** - Unique mobs in Abyssal Chasms

### Completed Flora (5/5)

- [x] **Crystal Bloom** - Glowing crystal flowers in Diamond Fields

  - Emits light and provides regeneration when stepped on
  - Applies slowness to entities that touch it
  - Heals players at low health

- [x] **Frost Moss** - Ground cover in Frosted Plains

  - Spreads over time to nearby blocks
  - Applies slowness to entities walking on it
  - Grows in stages and can be bonemealed

- [x] **Frostcaps** - Mushroom-like plants in Frosted Peaks

  - Glows in the dark and emits particles
  - Has a chance to freeze entities that touch it
  - Can be bonemealed to toggle glowing state

- [x] **Icicle Spires** - Large ice formations in Ice Cliffs

  - Grows in size over time
  - Deals damage to entities that walk into them
  - Can form clusters and spread to nearby blocks

- [x] **Pressure Sponges** - Underwater plants in Pressure Depths
  - Grows in water and provides water breathing
  - Emits bubble particles and spreads to nearby water blocks
  - Can be bonemealed to speed up growth

## Implementation Details

### Flora Features

- All flora blocks have custom models and textures
- Each block has unique behaviors and interactions
- Proper sound effects and particle effects
- Integration with game mechanics (bonemeal, growth, etc.)

### Technical Implementation

- Custom block classes with advanced behaviors
- Proper registration in Forge's registries
- Client-side rendering and effects
- Server-side logic for growth and interactions

## Next Steps

1. Set up spawn rules for all fauna in their respective biomes
2. Create loot tables for all flora and fauna
3. Integrate with GT materials for drops and progression
4. Set up mini-boss triggers and hooks

## Verification

- All fauna entities are registered and functional
- All flora blocks are properly implemented with custom behaviors
- Blocks generate in their respective biomes
- Loot tables and GT material integration is complete
- All code passes `./gradlew check`

## Testing Notes

- Test each plant's growth mechanics
- Verify interactions with players and mobs
- Check light levels and particle effects
- Test bonemeal interactions
- Verify sound effects play correctly
