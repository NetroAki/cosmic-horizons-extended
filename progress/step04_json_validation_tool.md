# T-004 JSON Validation Tool Implementation

## Changes Made

1. **Validated Existing Script**:

   - Confirmed that `scripts/validate_json.py` is already implemented with all required features:
     - Recursively scans for JSON files
     - Validates JSON syntax and structure
     - Handles common JSON extensions (comments, trailing commas)
     - Provides clear error messages
     - Has proper exit codes (0 for success, 1 for errors)
     - Includes Windows compatibility

2. **Documentation**:
   - Added a new "Development Tools" section to the README.md
   - Documented the script's usage, features, and behavior
   - Included a code block showing how to run the script

## Testing

Attempted to run the validation script, but Python is not installed on the system. The script is ready to use once Python is available.

## Next Steps

1. Install Python on the system to use the validation script
2. Consider adding the validation script to the CI/CD pipeline
3. Document any additional JSON schema validations if needed in the future
