- Rewrote CHEX_DETAILED_TASKS.md with planet-by-planet TODOs (Pandora through Neutron Star Forge) detailing dimension JSONs, biomes, structures, bosses, and audiovisual tasks.
- Captured supporting system work: registry overrides, travel graph, GTCEu minerals, launch validation, docs, QA, release prep.
- Ready to prioritise Section 2 per-planet deliverables beginning with dimension datapacks.
