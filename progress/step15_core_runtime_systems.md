# Step 15 - Core Runtime & Progression Systems (2025-01-21)

## Completed Tasks

### 1. PlanetRegistry Override System

- Extended `PlanetRegistry.registerDiscoveredPlanets` to merge overrides from `chex-planets.json5`
- Implemented `loadPlanetOverrides()` method to load configuration from file
- Added `applyOverrides()` method to merge planet definitions with overrides
- Updated `registerDiscoveredPlanets()` to apply overrides during discovery
- Fixed PlanetDef constructor calls to include all required parameters

### 2. Enhanced DumpPlanets Command

- Added `/chex dumpPlanets --reload` command with structured output
- Implemented `dumpPlanetsWithReload()` method that:
  - Reloads planet registry and discovery
  - Displays structured table with planet details
  - Writes enhanced JSON dump with all planet properties
  - Shows hazards, source, and other metadata

### 3. TravelGraph Validation System

- Added `/chex travelGraph validate` command
- Implemented `ValidationResult` class for validation results
- Added `validate()` method that checks for:
  - Unknown planets in travel graph
  - Invalid tier assignments
  - Conflicting planet assignments
  - Missing planets from registry
- Enhanced `getTravelGraphSummary()` method

### 4. PlayerTierCapability Enhancements

- Cleaned up duplicate PlayerTierCapability implementations
- Added utility methods:
  - `canAccessPlanet()` and `canAccessPlanetWithTier()`
  - `getMaxAccessibleTier()` and `getMaxSuitTier()`
  - `isAtMaxTier()` and `isAtMaxSuitTier()`
  - `resetProgression()` for resetting player progress
- Maintained existing sync packet system

### 5. FuelRegistry Fallback Fluids

- Extended CHEXFluids with additional fallback fluids:
  - DT Mix (T5) - Deuterium-Tritium fusion fuel
  - He3 Blend (T6) - Helium-3 fusion fuel
  - Exotic Mix (T7-T10) - Advanced exotic matter fuel
- Updated FuelRegistry initialization to include all 10 tiers
- Added proper fluid properties (density, viscosity, temperature, light level)
- Configured buckets and fluid blocks for new fuels

## Technical Details

### Planet Override System

- Overrides are loaded from `config/chex/chex-planets.json5`
- Supports both `planets` and `overrides` sections
- Merges with discovered planets from Cosmic Horizons
- Validates planet IDs and logs warnings for invalid entries

### Command Enhancements

- `/chex dumpPlanets --reload` provides comprehensive planet information
- `/chex travelGraph validate` ensures travel graph integrity
- Both commands provide detailed error reporting and success confirmation

### Fuel System

- 7 unique fuel types across 10 tiers
- Proper fluid properties for realistic behavior
- Integration with existing bucket and block systems
- Fallback system for when GTCEu is not present

## Next Steps

The core runtime and progression systems are now complete. The next phase would be implementing the planet-specific features (Pandora, Arrakis, etc.) as outlined in the detailed task matrix.
