# Step 12 - CI Workflow Added (2025-09-21)

- Authored GitHub Actions workflow running Gradle check and forge:runData on push/PR with gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v3.
- Enforced JSON drift detection via git diff --exit-code after the data run to catch missing commits.
- Captured supporting notes in notes/ci_workflow_notes.md and marked the infrastructure task complete.
