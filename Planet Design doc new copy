# 🎯 Design Goals

- **Integration-first:** Every planet, mob, and boss ties directly into GregTech CEu's tech tree — no "decorative" content without progression relevance.
- **Planetary Identity:** Each planet feels distinct in color palette, flora, fauna, hazards, and progression step. Players should be able to tell _at a glance_ where they are.
- **Challenge Scaling:** Planets progress from lush/hostile natural worlds → engineered megastructures. Each stage increases both survival difficulty and complexity of GT systems unlocked.
- **Alien Authenticity:** Default Minecraft mobs never appear. Every fauna is designed to fulfill an ecological and mechanical role (e.g., grazers = food/organic resources, predators = catalysts, drones = alloys).
- **Boss-Gated Progression:** Each planet has **3 mini-bosses + 1 main boss**. Mini-bosses drop _Cores_ that are required for GregTech crafting chains; main bosses drop the _planetary unlock_ for the next tier.

---

# 🛠️ Common Planetary Systems

## Block Foundations

- **Planetary Stone Base:** Each planet uses a unique "stone" type (Cryostone, Stormstone, Hollowstone, etc.) with texture variants (cracked, mossy, crystal-encrusted, etc.).
- **Soils:** Most planets use custom "metallic" or "hybrid" soils that tie to their biome logic.
- **Glowing Flora Blocks:** A consistent system of faint light-emitting plants/moss/fungi across all biomes keeps readability in dark alien spaces.

## Fauna & Resource Logic

- **Grazers/Passive mobs** → drop hides/fibers/organs → feed into **polymers, textiles, organics** in GT.
- **Predators** → drop fangs, scales, or energy organs → feed into **catalysts, circuits, rare materials**.
- **Construct/Drones** → drop alloy shards, circuits, fragments → feed into **robotics, nanomaterials, exo-suits**.
- **Exotic Creatures** → drop unique essences → feed into **quantum/photonics progression**.

## Boss Core System

- Every boss (mini or main) drops a **Core Item**.
- Cores serve 2 functions:
  - **Gatekeeping** → needed to craft or assemble new GT machines/tiers.
  - **Weapons/Tools** → sometimes double as unique equipment (e.g., ice blade, thunder hammer, fractal sword).

---

# ⚡ Progression Context

Here's the broad order of planets + GT unlocks:

1. **Pandora** → bio-organics, starter alien chemistry.
2. **Arrakis** → desert chemistry, hydrocarbons (spice → GT fuel chain).
3. **Alpha Centauri A** → solar harnessing, corona/energy plasma unlocks.
4. **Kepler-452b** → early alloys (iron, copper-like chains, agriculture upgrade).
5. **Aqua Mundus** → water chemistry, hydrothermal vents, lithium unlock.
6. **Inferno Prime** → magma smelting, basalt → high-temp alloys.
7. **Crystalis** → cryogenics, superconductors, diamond lattices.
8. **Stormworld** → exotic superconductors, HV power, exotic fuels.
9. **Ringworld Megastructure** → nanomaterials, structural alloys, robotics.
10. **Exotica** → photonics, quantum circuits, exotic catalysts.
11. **Torus World** → exotic matter, gravity manipulation.
12. **Hollow World** → void catalysts, pressure reactors.
13. **Shattered Dyson Swarm** → stellar energy systems, solar overdrives.
14. **Neutron Star Forge** → neutronium, exotic matter reactors, stellar forging.
15. **Cosmic Nexus** → ultimate endgame materials, reality manipulation.

---

# 🎨 Visual Style Notes

- **Lighting Philosophy:** Each planet should have a _primary color signature_ — Pandora = cyan/green glow, Arrakis = gold/orange, Crystalis = pale blue, Stormworld = lightning yellow/white, Ringworld = reflective silver.
- **UI Consistency:** Biomes could use **color-coded fog tints** (via Terrablender biome settings) to sell immersion — purple haze in void zones, gold haze in desert planets, blue frost mist in Crystalis.
- **Mob Design:** Each mob should feel _alien but functional_ — textures should avoid looking like reskinned vanilla mobs. Use exaggerated geometries (floating sacs, fractal horns, plasma veins, crystal hides).

---

# 🔑 Implementation Notes

- **Terrablender** is used for biome layering → each planet needs its own dimension with a custom noise generator (terrain control).
- **Oxygen Mod Hook:** Planets are flagged as breathable or not. Players must manage **suit upgrades** (crafted from boss cores + GT parts).
- **Hazard System:** Tie status effects (radiation, frostbite, plasma burn, void collapse) to **dimension effect handlers**, not mobs. This way, survival depends on gear, not just mob killing.
- **Drops → GT Recipes:** Every mob/boss drop should already map into a recipe slot. Example:
  - _Prism Hide_ → used in GT optical fiber recipe.
  - _Cryo Core_ → used to unlock GT liquid helium chain.
  - _Void Essence_ → used as void catalyst in late-tier reactors.

---

# 📖 Narrative/Flavor

- Each planet can have **hidden terminals/lore tablets** scattered in structures → reveal story fragments about the collapse of megastructures, failed colonists, ancient alien ecologies.
- The **bosses** aren't random monsters — they're guardians or apex predators of their environment, each themed to planet's logic.
- The **progression loop** feels like humanity gradually reclaiming alien/stellar technology through sheer engineering.

# 🌌 Additional Context for Cosmic Horizons x GregTech Addon

## 🎯 Design Goals

- **Integration-first:** Every planet, mob, and boss ties directly into GregTech CEu’s tech tree — no “decorative” content without progression relevance.
- **Planetary Identity:** Each planet feels distinct in color palette, flora, fauna, hazards, and progression step. Players should be able to tell _at a glance_ where they are.
- **Challenge Scaling:** Planets progress from lush/hostile natural worlds → engineered megastructures → stellar phenomena → neutron/exotic-matter realms. Each stage increases both survival difficulty and complexity of GT systems unlocked.
- **Alien Authenticity:** Default Minecraft mobs never appear. Every fauna is designed to fulfill an ecological and mechanical role (e.g., grazers = food/organic resources, predators = catalysts, drones = alloys).
- **Boss-Gated Progression:** Each planet has **3 mini-bosses + 1 main boss**. Mini-bosses drop _Cores_ that are required for GregTech crafting chains; main bosses drop the _planetary unlock_ for the next tier.

---

## 🛠️ Common Planetary Systems

### Block Foundations

- **Planetary Stone Base:** Each planet uses a unique “stone” type (Cryostone, Stormstone, Hollowstone, etc.) with texture variants (cracked, mossy, crystal-encrusted, etc.).
- **Soils:** Most planets use custom “metallic” or “hybrid” soils that tie to their biome logic.
- **Glowing Flora Blocks:** A consistent system of faint light-emitting plants/moss/fungi across all biomes keeps readability in dark alien spaces.

### Fauna & Resource Logic

- **Grazers/Passive mobs** → drop hides/fibers/organs → feed into **polymers, textiles, organics** in GT.
- **Predators** → drop fangs, scales, or energy organs → feed into **catalysts, circuits, rare materials**.
- **Construct/Drones** → drop alloy shards, circuits, fragments → feed into **robotics, nanomaterials, exo-suits**.
- **Exotic Creatures** → drop unique essences → feed into **quantum/photonics progression**.

### Boss Core System

- Every boss (mini or main) drops a **Core Item**.
- Cores serve 2 functions:

  - **Gatekeeping** → needed to craft or assemble new GT machines/tiers.
  - **Weapons/Tools** → sometimes double as unique equipment (e.g., ice blade, thunder hammer, fractal sword).

---

## ⚡ Progression Context

Here’s the broad order of planets + GT unlocks:

1. **Pandora** → bio-organics, starter alien chemistry.
2. **Arrakis** → desert chemistry, hydrocarbons (spice → GT fuel chain).
3. **Alpha Centauri A** → solar harnessing, corona/energy plasma unlocks.
4. **Kepler-452b** → early alloys (iron, copper-like chains, agriculture upgrade).
5. **Aqua Mundus** → water chemistry, hydrothermal vents, lithium unlock.
6. **Inferno Prime** → magma smelting, basalt → high-temp alloys.
7. **Crystalis** → cryogenics, superconductors, diamond lattices.
8. **Stormworld** → exotic superconductors, HV power, exotic fuels.
9. **Ringworld Megastructure** → nanomaterials, structural alloys, robotics.
10. **Exotica** → photonics, quantum circuits, exotic catalysts.
11. **Torus World** → exotic matter, gravity manipulation.
12. **Hollow World** → void catalysts, pressure reactors.
13. **Shattered Dyson Swarm** → stellar energy systems, solar overdrives.
14. **Neutron Star Forge** → neutronium, exotic matter reactors, stellar forging.
15. **Cosmic Nexus** → ultimate endgame materials, reality manipulation.
16. **Exotica** → photonics, quantum circuits, exotic catalysts.
17. **Torus World** → exotic matter, gravity manipulation.
18. **Hollow World** → void catalysts, pressure reactors.
19. **Shattered Dyson Swarm** → stellar energy systems, solar overdrives.
20. **Neutron Star Forge** → neutronium, exotic matter reactors, stellar forging.

---

## 🎨 Visual Style Notes

- **Lighting Philosophy:** Each planet should have a _primary color signature_ — Pandora = cyan/green glow, Arrakis = gold/orange, Crystalis = pale blue, Exotica = rainbow fractal, Stormworld = lightning yellow/white, Hollow World = cyan/purple/black, Dyson Swarm = reflective silver, Neutron Forge = red/blue-white plasma.
- **UI Consistency:** Biomes could use **color-coded fog tints** (via Terrablender biome settings) to sell immersion — purple haze in void zones, gold haze in desert planets, blue frost mist in Crystalis.
- **Mob Design:** Each mob should feel _alien but functional_ — textures should avoid looking like reskinned vanilla mobs. Use exaggerated geometries (floating sacs, fractal horns, plasma veins, crystal hides).

---

## 🔑 Implementation Notes

- **Terrablender** is used for biome layering → each planet needs its own dimension with a custom noise generator (terrain control).
- **Oxygen Mod Hook:** Planets are flagged as breathable or not. Players must manage **suit upgrades** (crafted from boss cores + GT parts).
- **Hazard System:** Tie status effects (radiation, frostbite, plasma burn, void collapse) to **dimension effect handlers**, not mobs. This way, survival depends on gear, not just mob killing.
- **Drops → GT Recipes:** Every mob/boss drop should already map into a recipe slot. Example:

  - _Prism Hide_ → used in GT optical fiber recipe.
  - _Cryo Core_ → used to unlock GT liquid helium chain.
  - _Void Essence_ → used as void catalyst in late-tier reactors.

---

## 📖 Narrative/Flavor

- Each planet can have **hidden terminals/lore tablets** scattered in structures → reveal story fragments about the collapse of megastructures, failed colonists, ancient alien ecologies.
- The **bosses** aren’t random monsters — they’re guardians or apex predators of their environment, each themed to planet’s logic.
- The **progression loop** feels like humanity gradually reclaiming alien/stellar technology through sheer engineering.

  - 2+ passive mobs (organics).
  - 2+ predators (catalysts).
  - 1–2 exotic/constructs (circuits/alloys).
  - 3 mini-bosses (cores).
  - 1 main boss (tier progression).

- **Mob Design Philosophy:**

  - No “vanilla replacements” → even food mobs must feel alien.
  - Drops → never just food; always **tie into GT materials**.
  - Biomes → fauna _fit environment_ (drakes in storm belts, serpents in voids, drones in ruins, etc.).
